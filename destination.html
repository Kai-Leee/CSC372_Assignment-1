	<h1>Travelogue: Korea</h1>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		Korea has everything: oceans, mountains, and even caves. You can also visit places that preserve the
		legacy of a 500-year dynasty and its historical moments. Want modern culture instead of nature and history?
		In Seoul, we can satisfy all of that.
